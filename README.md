## Purpose:
Google Earth Engine code accompanying our paper comparing global forest cover and forest cover change datasets. Code provided allows users the replicate our analyses in Google Earth Engine. 

## Data availability:
All datasets used in this study derive from published sources cited in the Methods section. The following datasets are available through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Data Catalog: (1) Copernicus Global Land Cover, (2) ESA WorldCover, (3) JAXA Forest/Non- Forest, (4) MODIS Land Cover Type, (5) WorldPop. ESA Copernicus Climate Change Service Land Cover was available for download from https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover (Accessed: 15 December 2023). ESRI Land Cover was available on GEE using the code available from https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/S2TSLULC/ (Accessed: 15 December 2023). GLAD Global Land Cover and Land Use Change was available on GEE using the code available from https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/GLCLUC2020 (Accessed: 15 December 2023). The species habitat ranges were obtained for the IUCN Red List database (available for download from: https://www.iucnredlist.org accessed on 15 December 2023). Biome limits were obtained from Ecoregions2017 (available for download from https://ecoregions.appspot.com/).
